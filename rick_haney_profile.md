# Dr. Richard “Rick” L. Haney — Profile Summary

## 1) Identity & Basics
- **Name:** Richard “Rick” L. Haney, Ph.D. — soil chemist/microbiologist; creator of the Haney Soil Health Test (also called the **Soil Health Nutrient Tool**). Former USDA-ARS researcher; today serves as Chief Scientific Officer at **Regen Ag Lab**. Lives in Texas.  
- **Age/Birth year:** Not publicly listed.  
- **Residence:** Texas (Temple area referenced frequently in interviews/bios).  
- **Family:** Married to **Dr. Liz Haney** (soil scientist; frequent collaborator/co-author). Many bios reference two daughters.

## 2) Family of Origin
- **Background:** Grew up farming in **Custer County, Oklahoma**, which informs his farmer-first, practical framing of soil science.

## 3) Education & Training
- **Ph.D.:** Soil microbial ecology & chemistry, **Texas A&M University**.  
- **Early orientation:** By the mid-1990s in grad school, he’d formulated the core idea: measure soil as a *living* system and mimic root chemistry in the lab.

## 4) Career Trajectory
- **USDA-ARS (Temple, TX):** Longtime researcher at the Grassland Soil & Water Research Lab; led development of the Soil Health Nutrient Tool (**Haney Test**) and its **H3A** extractant that simulates weak organic acids exuded by roots.  
- **Awards (USDA):** Widely cited as earning the **2017 USDA Plains Area & National Technology Transfer Awards** and **2018 USDA REE Under Secretary’s Award**/**Secretary of Agriculture Honor Award** for the Haney Test.  
- **Retirement & next chapter:** Retired from ARS in **2021** and moved into industry/education roles. Currently **Chief Scientific Officer** at **Regen Ag Lab** (NE).

## 5) Affiliations & Networks
- **USDA-ARS** alumnus; **NRCS** references the tool as the “Soil Health Nutrient Tool (Haney Test)” in CSP materials.  
- **Regen Ag Lab** (Chief Scientific Officer).  
- **Soil Regen / education circuit:** Frequent speaker/educator with Liz Haney; widely engaged with farmer-led events and the “Big Soil Health Event.”  
- **Community ties:** Regularly appears alongside practitioners and advocates like Ray Archuleta (NRCS), Rick Clark, Mitchell Hora, and groups like Noble Research Institute.

## 6) Reputation & Influence
- **Standing:** Often described as a legend/iconoclast in sustainable ag circles; widely recognized as the originator of a leading soil health test that integrates **biology + chemistry** (WEOC/WEON + 24-hr CO₂ burst + H3A).  
- **Public voice:** High-visibility interviews (e.g., **Yale Environment 360**) where he argues the system overuses fertilizer and undervalues biology; extensive podcast and field-day presence.  
- **Perception by peers:** Supportive among regen-ag leaders; some university extension scientists urge caution using the test for **fertilizer rate** decisions (calibration concerns).

## 7) Risk Profile
- **Behavioral:** **Principled contrarian**—comfortable challenging conventional soil testing (harsh extractants, narrow focus on N-P-K) and pushing for biologically-grounded, nature-mimicking methods.  
- **Financial/technical:** Advocates **reducing synthetic inputs** where data justify it—attractive economics to farmers but politically sensitive with input suppliers.  
- **Reliability:** Track record of peer-reviewed publication and technology transfer; awards indicate institutional credibility even amid debate.

## 8) Strategic Considerations (If you approach him as a friend, mentor, or partner)
- **Lead with farmer ROI.** Frame collaboration around **measurable reductions in fertilizer** spend without yield drag; offer rigorous A/B on-farm trials with transparent data sharing.  
- **Honor the biology.** Show how your models or products **incorporate WEOC/WEON, CO₂ burst, and C:N balance** rather than treating soil as inert.  
- **Be pragmatic about limits.** Acknowledge calibration gaps and propose joint validation in your geographies (e.g., Wisconsin/Kansas). Bring extension partners early to defuse “standard vs. new” tensions.  
- **Negotiation/decision style (inferred):** Prefers **evidence + field practicality** over theory; responds well to plain-spoken, farmer-centric framing; skeptical of hype.

## 9) Notable Connections
- **Dr. Liz Haney** — spouse, soil scientist, co-author on core papers; co-educator.  
- **Regen Ag Lab leadership** (e.g., Lance Gunderson) — current org; venue for scaling test interpretation.  
- **Movement figures:** Ray Archuleta (NRCS), farmers like Rick Clark; media/education platforms such as Field Work, Noble Research Institute.  
- **Labs running Haney Test:** Ward Laboratories (published interpretation guide; early adopter/educator).

## 10) Open Questions & Gaps (and suggested next steps)
- **Age/birth year & personal details:** Not readily available from authoritative sources. *Next step:* confirm via direct bio/CV or conference speaker materials.  
- **Regional calibration for fertility recs:** University extensions (e.g., Minnesota) caution against using Haney alone for N rates. *Next step:* co-design local correlation + calibration studies with your target crops/soils.  
- **Standardization across labs:** Differences in extraction/handling can affect comparability. *Next step:* align on SOPs and an inter-lab ring test with Regen Ag Lab.  
- **Evidence synthesis:** Compile peer-reviewed work (e.g., 2018 Applied Soil Ecology paper) plus state extension briefs (pro & con) into a single deck to brief partners.

## Quick primer on the **Haney Test**
Measures **24-hr CO₂-C (respiration)**, **water-extractable organic C & N (WEOC/WEON)**, and uses **H3A** & **H₂O** extracts to estimate plant-available nutrients more like roots do in nature; rolls into a **Soil Health Score**.  
**Use alongside** physical indicators (e.g., infiltration, bulk density, water holding capacity) for a complete soil health picture.
